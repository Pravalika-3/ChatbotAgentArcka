Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.\nThe only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution.

Every agent then reports back to its superior.\nIn the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.\nEvery agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks.
